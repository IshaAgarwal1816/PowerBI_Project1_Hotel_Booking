## âš¡ DAX Calculations Used  
Several **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) calculations** were implemented to derive meaningful insights from the dataset. Below are the key measures:  

```DAX
-- Total Booking Count
Booking Count = COUNT(bookings[Booking ID])

--  Cancellation Count
Cancellation Count = CALCULATE([Booking Count], bookings[Status] = "Cancelled")

-- Cancellation Percentage
Cancellation Pct = (SUM(bookings[Cancellation Count]) / SUM(bookings[Booking Count])) * 100

-- Total Revenue
Total Revenue = SUM(bookings[Revenue])

-- Total Room Nights
Total Room Nights = SUM(bookings[Number of nights])

-- Average Room Rate
Avg. Room Rate = DIVIDE(SUM(bookings[Room Rate]), SUM(bookings[Booking Count]))

-- Loyal Customer Booking Count
Loyal Customer Booking Count = CALCULATE(COUNT(bookings[Booking ID]), bookings[Loyalty Level] <> "Non-member")

-- Not Loyal Customer Booking Count
Not Loyal Customer Booking Count = CALCULATE(COUNT(bookings[Booking ID]), bookings[Loyalty Level] = "Non-member")

-- Multi-Night Booking Count
Multi-Night Booking Count = CALCULATE(COUNT(bookings[Booking ID]), bookings[Number of nights] > 1)

-- Single Night Booking Count
Single Night Booking Count = CALCULATE(COUNT(bookings[Booking ID]), bookings[Number of nights] = 1)

```
